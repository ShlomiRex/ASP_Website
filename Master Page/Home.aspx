            Grand Theft Auto V was announced by Rockstar Games on October 25, 2011, a few days after the tenth anniversary of Grand Theft Auto III. Every web page on Rockstar's network (even the old Vice City and San Andreas pages from 2002-2004) was replaced with a GTAV logo and a release date for the game's first trailer. The page also promoted the Twitter hashtag #GTAV.<br /><br />
            The one-and-a-half-minute-long trailer revealed that the game is set in the city of Los Santos - Rockstar's take on Los Angeles, California. Soon after, Grand Theft Auto V was officialy annonced in a Take-Two Interactive press statement. In the statement, Rockstar confirmed that "Grand Theft Auto V heads to the city of Los Santos and surrounding hills, countryside and beaches in the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar has yet created." Rockstar also asserted that GTA V is "a bold new direction in open-world freedom, storytelling, mission-based gameplay and online multiplayer [..] focusing on the pursuit of the almighty dollar in a re-imagined, present-day Southern California."

                Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.

                Initially, Grand Theft Auto V was scheduled for release in Spring of 2013 (beginning of March to the end of May). On January 31, 2013, Rockstar posted on the Newswire stating that Grand Theft Auto V would no longer be scheduled for a Spring 2013 release as the game "simply needs a little more polish to be of the standard we and, more importantly, you require." The new scheduled release date for Grand Theft Auto V is September 17, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
